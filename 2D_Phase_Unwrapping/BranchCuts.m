% BranchCuts.m generates branch cuts based on the phase residues. This is
% done using the Goldstein method, as described in "Two-dimensional phase 
% unwrapping: theory, algorithms and software" by Dennis Ghiglia and 
% Mark Pritt.
% "residue_charge" is a matrix wherein positive residues are 1 and 
% negative residues are 0. 
% "max_box_radius" defines the maximum search radius for the balancing of 
% residues. If this is too large, areas will be isolated by the branch
% cuts.
% "IM_mask" is a binary matrix. This serves as an artificial border for the
% branch cuts to connect to.
